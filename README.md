### Hi there is no point of showing your emotion because there is no market for emotion, just showing your attitudes
Never stop learning because life never stop teaching
Show them your results, but never show them your plan because your results talk themselves to them
Never cry for those who hurt you, just smile and say: thanks you for give me chance to find someone better than you
Stop fighting and angriness because life is short, time is fast and repy or rewind; enjoy everything as it comes
