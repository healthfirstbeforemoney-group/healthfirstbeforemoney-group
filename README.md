### Hi there is no point of showing your emotion because there is no market for emotion, just showing your attitudes.
Never stop learning because life never stop teaching.
Show them your results, but never show them your plan because your results talk themselves to them.
Never cry for those who hurt you, just smile and say: thanks you for give me chance to find someone better than you.
Stop fighting and angriness because life is short, time is fast and no repy or no rewind; enjoy everything as it comes.
Some difficulties come into your life do not to come to destroy you, but to help you to realise your potential and power.
Your present situation no matter whatever it is, is not your final destination, keep calm the best things are yet to come.
Trust for your customers, friends and suppliers mean everything, but when that trust is broken, then sorry for them means nothing.
Never give up, your days are yet to come, just a matter of time.
When you are helping others and expecting something in return, you are doing business, not kindness.
Doing a business is not a joke, so never reply your customers or friends or suppliers when you are angry, never promise your customers or friends or suppliers with something when you are happy and never make decisions on whatever you to do when you are sad.
Stop expecting loyalty from people who cannot even give you honesty. But nevertheless, remember that whenever you wish good things to others, good things come back to you.
